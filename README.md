# License Plate Detection

The image processing class is where the functions are collected.

The __init__ function is the first place to run.

alfa.pt will be developed and edited over time.


Image Processing

Image processing using OpenCV and artificial intelligence. alfa.pt was developed using Yolov5 artificial neural networks. 

To ensure high FPS, the torrch library is used, which provides extensive support for machine learning algorithms 
from pytorch and is based on the CUDA implementation. 

alfa.pt is a model that identifies both cars and license plates, and the interior of the identified 
license plates is read using the EasyOCR library.

With the help of OpenCV, car and license plate identification is achieved using a real-time camera.
Threads are used to reduce the workload and make the code run faster.
